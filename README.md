## 🚀 Installation Guide

Follow these detailed steps to get the project running locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the project from GitHub and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Satish-970/DevHub-JavaFullStack.git
   cd DevHub-JavaFullStack

Set Up the Backend:

Navigate to the backend folder (e.g., backend/ or root if no separate folder).
Update the configuration file (src/main/resources/application.properties or application.yml) with your database credentials (e.g., URL, username, password).
Build and run the backend:
bashmvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run

The backend will start on http://localhost:8080 (or your configured port).


Set Up the Frontend (if applicable):

Navigate to the frontend folder (e.g., frontend/ if included).
Install dependencies and start the development server:
bashnpm install
npm start

The frontend typically runs on http://localhost:3000 (check configuration).


Set Up the Database:

Install and start your chosen database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB).
Create a new database (e.g., devhub_db).
Run any provided SQL scripts (in the docs/ or scripts/ folder) to initialize the database schema and seed data.




🎮 How to Use the Project
Once set up, here’s how to interact with the application:


TaskInstructionsAccess the AppOpen http://localhost:8080 in your browser (or the configured port).Test APIsUse tools like Postman or cURL to send requests to the REST APIs. Example: curl http://localhost:8080/api/health.Read DocumentationCheck the /docs folder for API specifications, Swagger docs, or other guides (if available).
Example API Call:
bashcurl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/health
This checks if the backend is running and returns a status response.
